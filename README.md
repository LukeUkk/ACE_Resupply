# ACE_Resupply
Neky-Supply Installation
* When using this script, you need to have a Scripts folder.

* Then you just place the Nekky_supply folder in your scripts folder and make sure its called NEKKY_Supply.

* You will then need to create an init.sqf file and put this code in to it.
* execVM "Scripts\NEKY_supply\Aceresupply.sqf";
* execVM "Scripts\NEKY_supply\Acemed.sqf";



Only Actuall and Squad leaders can use this and it only works on a MP enviroment so test your mission on lan. You can edit the templates found in the folder to change what equipment is dropped.
Script was made by Neko and adapted to Ace by Luke.
