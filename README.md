# ACE_Resupply
Neky-Supply
When using this script, you need to have a Script folder so take thee "Aceresupply.sqf" and the "Acemed.sqf" and put it in side the script folder
then you just place the nekky supply folder in your scripts folder.

You will then need to create an init.sqf file and put this code in to it.
execVM "Scripts\Acepickup.sqf";
execVM "Scripts\Aceresupply.sqf";

Only Actuall and squad leaders can use this and it only works on a server so test your mission on lan.
